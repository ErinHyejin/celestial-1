Site Introduction in slide-2:
Our Earth provides an atmosphere and home for animals and plants unlike any other planet we know of. Earth does this as a member of our Solar System that we share with diverse bodies of mass including a star, other planets, many moons, comets, asteroids and countless meteorites. Meteorites are crumbs of asteroids and comets that come to stay with us here on Earth. This is celestial, a site that presents meteorites through profiles, pictures, graphs, maps and a globe.

Profile on Willamette Meteorite -
This is the Willamette Meteorite, it was discovered in Oregon and remains the largest meteorite found in the North American continent. It has religious significance to the Grand Ronde Native American Tribes of that region, they call it Tomanowos. The Willamette Meteorite has a distinct spongy appearance because its time on earth caused chemical reactions to produce acid that wore away parts of the original mass. Both of these featured picutres were taken in the American Museum of Natural History. The picture with the boys was taken in 1910; the meteorite is still in the Museum, but we can't touch it anymore.
